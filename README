PTFS - is a file system allowing to navigate through parse tree. 
Essential parameters for mounting are a file with some text and 
a parsing expressions grammar (describing the structure of input text).

The goal of the project is to create hacker friendly environment for writing
source code mining and transformation utilities.

Note: currently, PTFS is at the early stage of development so
      it is very unstable and not feature complete.

BUILD
=====
Install ocaml 3.10 or later.
On debian you can simply run: 
	$ apt-get install ocaml-nox

To build ptfs, run:
	$ ./configure (or ./autogen.sh in git repo)
	$ make

INSTALLATION
============
To install, run:
	$ make install


USAGE EXAMPLE
=============
To mount a new parse tree type:
	$ ptfs -g examples/arith.peg examples/text  mountpoint

To see the subtext related with a node (directory) in a parse tree 
use something like:
	$ cat mountpoint/path_to_node/text
	
To unmount use:
	$ fusermount -u mointpoint

AUROCHS CHANGES.
================
PTFS uses Aurohcs (https://github.com/berke/aurochs) as 
a backend parser (code in 'src/aurochs' subdir).
Aurochs slightly modified for the PTFS needs.
To find out modifications use 'ptfs hack' phrase in the Aurochs code.
