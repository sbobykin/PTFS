File: src/rw.c (src/read.c previously)

The code reused according to the note for 'src/ptfs.c' (date: 2009-04-18)
was moved to this file.
This note was actual for the renamed file 'src/read.c' too.

Date: 2009-06-22
File: src/ptfs.c

The code for handling version and help options 
was reused from 'Hello_World_(fuse_opt.h)' and
sshfs version 2.7.
The web page of 'Hello_World_(fuse_opt.h)' example:
http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/fuse/index.php?title=Hello_World_%28fuse_opt.h%29
The web site of the sshfs project: http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html.

Use 'FUSE_OPT_' keyword to find out
reused code from 'Hello_World_(fuse_opt.h)'

The code in the function 'sshfs_opt_proc' (the file: 'sshfs.c')
from sshfs version 2.7 was used as a template for the function 'ptfs_opt_proc'.


Date: 2009-06-19
File: src/ptfs.c

The code in the function 'map_file_to_str' earlier reused from 
'http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/output/html/multipage/mmapp.html'
was rewritten from scratch using glib functions 'g_mapped_file.*'. 

Date: 2009-06-17.
Files: src/ptfs.c, src/fuse_ops.c
The code related with FUSE operations was moved from 'src/ptfs.c' to 'src/fuse_ops.c'.
The struct 'hello_oper' was renamed to 'ptfs_ops'

Date: 2009-06-15.
File: src/Makefile.am 
The target .c.o was written using the analogous target from automatically 
generated 'src/Makefile' (Automake verion 1.10.2 was used).

Rewritten '.c.o':
=====
.c.o:
	$(CPP) -M -MF $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo $(DEPS_CFLAGS) -I../aurochs/include/  $<
	$(OCAMLC) $(OCAMLC_CCOPT) $(DEPS_OCAMLC_CCOPT) $<
	mv -f $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo $(DEPDIR)/$*.Po
=====

Original '.c.o':
=====
.c.o:
        $(COMPILE) -MT $@ -MD -MP -MF $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo -c -o $@ $<
        mv -f $(DEPDIR)/$*.Tpo $(DEPDIR)/$*.Po
=====
To see the original target (in 'src/Makefile') 
comment out rewritten (in 'src/Makefile.am).
Note: tested using automake version 1.10.2.

The file 'src/Makefile' contains copyright note, below is a text.

Files: src/ptfs.c src/parse.c
Parser related code was moved from 'src/ptfs.c' to 'src/parse.c'

Date: 2009-04-18.
File: src/ptfs.c
The following code was reused from http://fuse.sourceforge.net/helloworld.html
('hello_read' function) in the 'ptfs_write' function:
"  
   if (offset < len) {
        if (offset + size > len)
            size = len - offset;
        memcpy(buf, hello_str + offset, size);
    } else
        size = 0;
".

 
Date: 2009-04-09.
File: src/ptfs.c
Directory: aurochs/
Parser related code from Cocom project was removed.
New parser related code was derived from "cnog/check.c" of
the Aurochs distribution version 1.0.93.
The web site of the Aurochs project: http://aurochs.fr
The directory 'aurochs/' containing aurochs version 1.0.93  sources  
was added and then modified to connect 'ptfs' and 'aurochs':
	'aurochs/cnog/cnog.c': default attribute 'text' was added;
	'aurochs/aurochs/compiler.ml': function 'compile1' was registered to
	use ocaml function 'compile' in c code.
	'src/compilewrap.c': contains code for calling ocaml compiler1 function.
	'src/ptfs.c': modified for using Aurochs as a backend parser
Modifications were marked by 'ptfs hack' keyword.

Date: 2008-11-14.
File: src/ptfs.c
This file was created using three sources by Stanislav Bobykin.

- Parser related code was derived from "AMMUNITION/earlyey.c" of 
  the Cocom distribution version 0.996. 
  The web site of the Cocom project: http://cocom.sourceforge.net

- FUSE related code was derived from 
  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/helloworld.html
  http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/fuse/index.php?title=Hello_World_%28fuse_opt.h%29
  The code from these examples was used as a template
  for realizing the FUSE subsystem in PTFS.
  Keywords for the FUSE related code:
	'struct options'
	'struct fuse_operations hello_oper'
  Macros 'HELLOFS_OPT_KEY' was reused and renamed to 'PTFS_OPT_KEY'.

- File reading (mmap) code was derived from 
  http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/output/html/multipage/mmapp.html
